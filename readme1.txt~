I did not go to TA hours for Stage 1 of this project, but 


questions/problems:

-should edges connected to deleted nodes also be deleted?
--yes. implemented
-how to write the updated hashcode and what is it for?
--update learned how to write it but not really because how do you multiply nodes
-how to traverse a graph and what is that used for
--update learned how but not why
-is there any way to find a specific node without having to know its index in the array?
--also talked about this in class, will work out better in the GUI
