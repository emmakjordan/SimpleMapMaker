I did not go to TA hours for Stage 1 of this project, but I asked a couple Piazza questions that helped me, and most of my other questions were answered in class on Tuesday.

Some problems I had and solved during this stage included being unsure if edges connected to deleted nodes should also be deleted, and not knowing how to write the updated hashCode method.

I chose to use ArrayLists as the predefined data structures for most of the methods I have written so far because all I needed from them was a list of nodes or edges that I could easily traverse and also determine whether they contained a certain object. A HashSet might also be useful for these functions, and I might consider switching out some of the ArrayLists for HashSets if I need any that will be used for more than a handful of nodes in the future.

Note: the Node and Edge classes within Graph are currently public for testing purposes, but will probably be made private in the final version.
