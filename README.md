# SimpleMapMaker
Simple GUI interface in Java that allows the user to create a map using nodes and edges on a graph to represent distances between places.

Compile all files and run the file GraphGUI.java to start program.

Use buttons to switch between add/delete modes for nodes and edges. At least 2 nodes are required to add an edge. You will be prompted to input node names for each new node and distances for each new edge; distances must be a valid number. "Get Directions" mode allows you to calculate the shortest distance between any two nodes.

File saving functionality does not currently work, but program can read in an existing graph from a text file ("samplegraph.txt" is included as example).
